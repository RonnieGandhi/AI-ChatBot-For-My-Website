Give the Christian Science Monitor a try.  I think they're the only independent paper left.
True.  If it were 100% accurate with wouldn't be a forecast--it would be a prophecy.
&gt;One problem is, IMO the word “meta” programming. To me it implies that there is so much magic involved that not even the programmer knows whats going on anymore newlinechar  newlinechar you clearly only know languages in which it is difficult then.
Who reads directions??
why not split the keyboard and put each half on the insides of the pockets?
Don't you mean Shirley?
If it's possible, the Japanese will be the ones who do it.
&gt; In the case of most addicts, they just keel over right there, on their keyboard, dead as a board. newlinechar  newlinechar Gosh, really? How many WOW players have died at the keyboard so far? 
What difference would it make? The press is already a shill for the state.
John Edwards and Hillary Clinton spoofed themselves on the Colbert Report last week.
Two 0s would make it 8M.

I might ave answered my own question; this link seems to have promise. newlinechar http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/
Think of the sheeple!
That has happened. Well, it wasn't an asteroid, it was South America, but for 15th Century Europe the impact was the same. That was an unprecedented inflationary event.
Ah. That stinks (for us). Will keep that in mind.
To me, the laugh seems very calculated to deflate weighty, awkward questions.  When she laughs, she implicitly frames the topic as silly.  You can watch her use the laugh whenever a question doesn't fall into the categories of topic she's prepared to answer or redirect.
Just the cute seals, or do you propose we stop killing chickens, cows, and deer as well?
Actually I have to admit I might've been misinformative of what I said in the 'making this shit myself' statement.  I'd much rather control a legion of followers who build what is necessary for the green economy.

What if you're a faker pretending to be sunshine-x?  That wouldn't be cool either.
How do you know?  
It's extremely important to point out that religion does not have a monopoly on 'dogmatic, calcified thinking.' newlinechar  newlinechar Without that realization, you're prone to making all the same mistakes, because you just assume without religion you're exempt from whatever it is that makes religion bad.
Iraqognize that your puns are Spaining out of control, but Cayman, do we really need Yemen spitting such ludicrous propUganda? I just can't Afghanistand it...
Ok, how very informative, and impressive to boot. Sadly I knew all of that already and was merely wondering why this technology was present in the screenshots of the new UI and not in the old, other than possibly making it look better, therefore illiciting a more positive response.
Either you didn't read the story or you are stupid and can't comprehend what it is saying.  I can't continue to engage with people like that.

I concur. And if empirical evidence gets in the way of the much-vaunted 'models', like absence of warming in the lower atmosphere, they resort to mud-slinging and denigration of character. Climate alarmism has much more in common with religion than science. 
He wasn't the first and he was far from the last. It was during the greco-roman era pretty common knowledge amongst the educated. Amongst the uneducated... who can tell?
Problem is, for Rudy, no one will give a fuck about his great adventures on 9/11, 4 years from now.
Yeah, the pants minus the keyboard, speakers and mouse actually look cool.
Then, you are probably, screwed.

Yes, tags are great, though that sort of tag popularity listing isn't near as functional as a simple list. 
That is a very cool table.  Do you know what the word 'grant' means?  Look down the column labeled 'Grant' for all categories.  Tell me the US has not been giving grants to Israel.   newlinechar  newlinechar

Im sorry that your tiny brain sees anything that differs from your warped POV as trolling, but stfu?
I disagree with your dynamic linking example. While this may be true for Windows, I think it has a huge advantage on *nix systems that have good package managers. newlinechar  newlinechar Your point about it 'excuses people who make huge stupid libraries' is certainly true, however.

What's the point? Kind of like dog sweaters and  stuff like that?
Right after the interview, he explained that he would have liked to ask follow up questions, but they were limited to 15 minutes. To me it also seemed like she was drawing out her responses to kill time.
What is your opinion of it?  Is it any good?
Simply incredible how stupid they think we are. But it proves only one thing: The NeoCons are totally desperate, because the majority of the people doesn't believe their 9/11 fairy tale any longer.
I agree.  It is terrible, this idea.
&gt; Gravity provides a constant downward acceleration newlinechar  newlinechar Well, if you hold it steady enough by counteracting the force of gravity, then there will be no or negligible acceleration.
